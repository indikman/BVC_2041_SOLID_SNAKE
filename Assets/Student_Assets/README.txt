I encountered an odd error i don't have time to fix...
Events were all working and calling properly. Events would properly play itemused.wav, check off the item on the menu, etc...
But upon trying to final task to clean inputs... They stopped working.
SOMETHING is checking all the SO Bools as complete.
I simply do not have the time to finish that.

Thus, i hand this in to receive a mark.
