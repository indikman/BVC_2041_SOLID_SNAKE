As I was playtesting, I realized issues I just couldn't find an answer to.
With the doors, I realized that the door meshes on some doors would become combined in playmode for some odd reason.
This would lead these doors to just not be able to move at all.
You can try to re-assign their meshes in playmode, but they don't save once you exit out of playmode.
The front door to the shop, for example, doesn't have its mesh combined when the game is in play mode. This means it can easily be movable.
I have no idea why this is, but I know my code works. The meshes for some doors just get combined to "root scene" and I don't even know what that means.
