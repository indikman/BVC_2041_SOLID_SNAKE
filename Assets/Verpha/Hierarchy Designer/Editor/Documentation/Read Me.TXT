I'm currently remaking Hierarchy Designer from scratchâ€”every single script, line of code, and feature is being rewritten. This is necessary because the current code is poorly written and unsustainable. It had to be redone eventually, as it was becoming harder to maintain with each release. That being said, update 1.1.1 will take some time to be released, but it will be worth the wait as the new version will be much better in all aspects.
Thank you in advance for your patience. 
Best regards, Verpha.
